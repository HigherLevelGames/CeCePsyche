Quick Start:

Create an empty game object and add the RainCreator script to it. Set the 'Rain Type' to 'Normal Rain'
and move the game object to the position at which you want your rain to be instantiated.
The rain will be instantiated when the game starts.


Rain Creator Usage:

Rain Type: The amount of rain you want in your scene
	0 - Soft Rain, highest performance, small amount of rain
	1 - Normal Rain, medium performance, normal amount of rain (Recommended)
	2 - Heavy Rain, this can halve your fps on low end machines (!!), highest amount of rain

Local Position: Position (local space) at which the rain will be instantiated
	If the RainCreator is parented to an first person camera I recommend setting the y-value to 9
